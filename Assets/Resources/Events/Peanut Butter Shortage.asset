  m_Name: Peanut Butter Shortage
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  description: The lack of peanut butter in the city of Modar caused riots. Don't
    let people wait for their favorite snack, do something! I remember that I lost
    a whole jar in an underground garden - that was like 3 years ago.
  succesMessage: '{0} so the city is saved!'
  failMessage: People won't tolerate this anymore, the peanut butter revolution is
    upon us and the fact that {0} is unimportant.
